# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple yet functional to-do list web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Local storage persistence (tasks are saved between sessions)
- Responsive design
- Clean, modern UI

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - Styling for the application
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality

## How It Works

The application is built with vanilla JavaScript, using localStorage to persist tasks between browser sessions. The UI is styled with CSS to provide a clean, user-friendly interface.

### Functionality

1. **Adding Tasks**: Type your task in the input field and click "Add Task" or press Enter
2. **Completing Tasks**: Click the "Complete" button to mark a task as done
3. **Deleting Tasks**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task
4. **Persistence**: All tasks are automatically saved to localStorage

## Running the Application

To run this application, simply open `index.html` in a web browser, or serve it through a local web server.
